            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                Any, as long as the client has
                <a href="https://optifine.net/home" target="_blank">Optifine</a>
                pre-installed it will work perfectly fine! You can also use this
                without a client, just make sure that you have
                <a href="https://optifine.net/home" target="_blank">Optifine</a>
                installed! It does also work on Badlion Client, however this
                does require a few extra steps to complete!
